# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes how Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index)
affects trader profitability and behavior on Hyperliquid.

## Folder Contents
- notebook_1.ipynb : Main analysis notebook
- ds_report.pdf : Final summarized report
- csv_files/ : Processed datasets and summary tables
- outputs/ : Charts and visualizations

## Key Insights
- Extreme Fear has the highest average PnL but low win rate.
- Neutral sentiment shows the most consistent performance.
- Fear and Greed regimes involve larger trade sizes and higher fees.

## Dataset Note

The original historical trader dataset file is larger than GitHub’s upload limit (>25MB), 
so it is not included in this repository.

It can be downloaded from the assignment link provided in the instructions.

All analysis can be reproduced by placing the dataset inside the project directory 
and running `notebook_1.ipynb`.

## How to Run
Open notebook_1.ipynb in Google Colab and run all cells.
